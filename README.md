# LLM Experimentation

This repository contains my experiments and explorations with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Current Experiments

* **test_gemma.ipynb:** This notebook explores the capabilities of the Gemma model using the Hugging Face library. 

## Future Work

* Experiment with other LLMs (e.g., Llama 2, GPT models).
* Fine-tune models on specific tasks.
* Explore different prompting techniques.

This repository will be updated regularly with new experiments and findings.
